**Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Overview and Activity**

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a powerful statistical technique used to test the difference in means among three or more groups. ANOVA helps determine whether population means differ across groups, making it a crucial tool for answering various business questions.

### Activity Overview:
In this activity, you will step into the role of a data professional analyzing historical marketing promotion data. Your task is to conduct a one-way ANOVA and a post hoc ANOVA test to evaluate the impact of different marketing promotions on sales. Afterward, you'll communicate your findings to stakeholders, helping you build the confidence to make informed recommendations in a professional setting.

### Dataset Context:
Each row in your dataset represents a unique marketing promotion. The business uses various promotion types—including TV, social media, radio, and influencers—to boost sales. While you’ve already provided insights into how different promotion types influence sales, stakeholders are now interested in understanding whether there are significant differences in sales between different TV and influencer promotion types.

### Objectives:
To address this request, you will:

1. **Select a Categorical Independent Variable**  
   Use plots and descriptive statistics to identify the categorical variable that best fits your analysis.
   
2. **Fit a Linear Regression Model**  
   Create and fit a linear regression model with the chosen categorical variable to understand its impact on sales.
   
3. **Check Model Assumptions**  
   Ensure that the assumptions for your model are met to ensure reliable results.
   
4. **Perform a One-Way ANOVA Test**  
   Conduct a one-way ANOVA to determine if there are statistically significant differences in sales among the different groups.
   
5. **Post Hoc Analysis**  
   If necessary, perform a post hoc ANOVA test to compare specific pairs of groups and understand the nuances of the differences.
   
6. **Interpret and Communicate Results**  
   Interpret the model outputs and effectively communicate your findings to nontechnical stakeholders.
